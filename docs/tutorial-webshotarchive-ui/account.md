A Subscription is required to use the Webshot Archive and the basic plan is only $5 per month. This is a great way to get started with the Webshot Archive and see how it can help you capture screenshots of your website and compare them to previous screenshots.

:::info
Webshot Archive is currently in beta and the pricing is subject to change. I'm a solo developer and I'm trying to make this as affordable as possible for small teams and individuals
while at the same time making sure I can keep developing and maintaining the Webshot Archive.
