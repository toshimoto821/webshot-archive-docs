# Project Dashboard

![Webshot Archive Project Dashboard](/img/screenshots/ui-tour-project-dashboard.png)

The project dashboard is where you can view all of a projects screenshots. The left menu allows you to view the projects file tree and the right menu allows you to view the projects Git timeline. Using the two sidebars you can navigate the project and view / compare the screenshots across time.

:::tip
Because of the way image comparisons work, you can not compare images of different sizes. This means that if you have an e2e test that may grow or shrink in page size, you wont be able to compare those screenshots. If you would like to prevent the image sizes from changing, cypress and e2e test tools allow you to set a specific width and height on the screenshot as opposed to the full page.
