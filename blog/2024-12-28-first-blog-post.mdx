### About Webshot Archive

I was working on Toshi Moto and wanted a better way to review and store my cypress.io screenshots. Not finding any tools that fit my needs, I decided to build my own. Rather than build it into my current side project, I decided to build it as a separate service.

- Your personal repository of application screenshots.
- Use it to help identify unexpected changes to your application.
- Use it to help review changes to your application over time.

### About me

- For my day job I'm a Front End Engineer at large company.
- This is a side project that I'm working on in my free time.
- I use a pseudonym of Toshi Moto after Satoshi Nakamoto to maintain my privacy.
- I was inspired to build this project when working on another project ([Tosho Moto](https://github.com/toshimoto821/toshi-moto), a watch only bitcoin wallet).
