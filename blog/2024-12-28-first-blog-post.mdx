### About Webshot Archive

I was working another side project [Toshi Moto](https://github.com/toshimoto821/toshi-moto) (a watch only bitcoin wallet) and wanted a better way to review and store cypress.io screenshots. Not finding any tools that fit my needs, I decided to build my own. Rather than build it into my current side project, I decided to build it as a separate service. I see it as a tool that can be used for a variety of use cases:

- A private repository of application screenshots.
- A way to identify unexpected changes to your application.
- Watch and review changes to your application over time.

### About me

- For my day job I'm a Front End Engineer at a large company (not in any way affiliated with Webshot Archive).
- This is a side project that I'm working on in my free time.
- I use a pseudonym of Toshi Moto after Satoshi Nakamoto to maintain my privacy.
